# StimulationButton
Have you ever wanted to just click, click, click buttons on the Geometry Dash main menu?
Well, do I have a mod for you, for the low, low price of one more download on my GitHub repository, you can get yourself a clean, shiny, big fat button on your screen that does nothing at all!
